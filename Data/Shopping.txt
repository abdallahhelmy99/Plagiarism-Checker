Online shopping has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many consumers finding it convenient and easy to shop from the comfort of their own homes. However, there are also barriers that can prevent people from engaging in online shopping. These barriers can be classified into two categories: motives and barriers.

MOTIVES:

Convenience: One of the main motives for online shopping is the convenience it offers. Consumers can shop at any time of the day or night, from any location with an internet connection, and avoid the hassle of driving to a physical store or standing in line to make a purchase.

Variety: Online shopping offers a wide variety of products and brands to choose from, making it easy for consumers to find exactly what they are looking for.

Price: Online shopping often offers competitive prices and discounts, which can be a strong motive for consumers.

Comparison shopping: Online shopping allows consumers to easily compare prices and features of different products, helping them make informed purchasing decisions.

BARRIERS:

Security concerns: Some consumers may be hesitant to shop online due to concerns about the security of their personal and financial information.

Trust: Consumers may be hesitant to shop online if they do not trust the website or the seller.

Difficulty of returning products: Some consumers may be discouraged from shopping online if they are unsure about the process of returning a product or if they fear they will be stuck with a product they are not satisfied with.

Shipping costs and delivery times: Shipping costs and delivery times may be perceived as barriers to online shopping, especially for consumers who need their purchases delivered quickly.

Lack of touch and feel: Some consumers may prefer to physically see and touch a product before making a purchase, which can be a barrier to online shopping.
